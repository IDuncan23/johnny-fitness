          <p>&quot;My name is John Duncan. I was born and raised In North Philadelphia. I had a very average upbringing, nothing to special. I grew up in separate houses with my parents but they both still made sure my brother and I were taken care of.<p>

<p>My path of obesity began at a very young age. Being born into a family who favors traditional black family food, also know as “Soul Food”, made it hard to stay away. The fried chicken, baked mac and cheese, candied yams, and sodium filled collard greens weren’t just your holiday specials in my house. It was the norm and it was all any of us knew. </p>

<p>As I got older I became more independent. Earning money by doing chores or hustling  on my own just to get a couple bucks to have in my pocket. I began to buy a lot food like junk snacks during and after school.  It became my way with dealing with any stress school or life may have brought me in general. If I had ten dollars, chances are that would be spent on a sourdough burger from Burger King. Very bad habit I developed. </p>

<p>Food to me was an escape. When I ate, I only thought about eating. Nothing else mattered when I devoured my most favorite meal. It just felt good. That plus me not knowing what’s good and what’s not to put in our bodies, I was headed down a dark path. </p>

<p>College was by far the worst when it came to my eating habits. I had no restrictions... at all. I ate what I wanted and when I wanted. No one denied me of that god given right. I loved every minute of it. So much so that I hurdled over the freshman 15 and gained a whopping 45 pounds in my first year. After my second year of college, I dropped out and decided to pursue my life as an artist. At this time I had to been upwards of at least 240 pounds. Definitely feeling a negative way about it, especially because my friends were slim. I was “that fat guy”. That sucked so bad for me. I began getting extremely depressed about my appearance. Yet, and still, I continued eating. </p>

<p>Eventually I met the love of my life and we moved in together. Shortly after, I began gaining weight due to portion sizes of my meals that were made at home; on top of hardly being active. I ate big because I felt like I needed too. I snacked more and more; no matter the size, no matter the calories, no matter the ingredients. If I wanted it, I ate it.  </p>

<p>When my daughter was born, I promised myself to be the best dad I could be. The fact of the matter is couldn’t be that father I wanted to be. I was obese and couldn’t do even the simplest of tasks. It was tough doing anything, but especially dealing with a running baby. </p>

<p>I remember vividly the day it all changed for me. My daughter and I visited the park and I tried playing with my baby, but I couldn’t do it. I could barely breathe from just a light jog around the jungle gym. I was down, I was done and I was tired. At this point I’m ready to go. I decide to leave and the look my daughter gave me was devastating. She was just extremely sad and I couldn’t even use the “come on we been here for a while now” excuse; we had only been there for roughly twenty minutes.</p>

<p>From that moment, I knew things had to change - and had to change immediately. Once I got home , I literally cleaned out everything that was not good for me. </p>

<p>I, then, started off small. Taking baby steps and learning everything I could as I went along with this new found way of thinking and, most importantly, eating. I began with substituting foods: whole raw eggs for egg whites, pork bacon and beef bacon for turkey bacon, etc. I’ve also incorporated more veggies into my meals; the same with lunch and dinner. Making smaller amounts and drinking more water. </p>

<p>With that alone, I began losing weight and I began feeling a surge of confidence. I began to fell like this is totally doable. So I continued on. My girlfriend even decided to embark on that very same journey with me. She too lost a considerable amount of weight just from eating in a cleaner and healthier way. Having your partner join you on such journey only gives you more fuel to reach your goals.&quot;</p>
